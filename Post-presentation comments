#Comments from presentation

Pros:
-Good presentation skills

Cons:
-Bin data for legibility
-Could include diagram/schematic for data structures for audience readability
-Not a con, but Dominic and Daphne used a web service to accomplish the job, which is computationally cheaper
  -They used rcsb web service to do a custom search to get the date and weights as parameters
