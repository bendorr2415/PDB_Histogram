# PDB_Histogram
Programming Fundamentals Final Project

This assignment was written for the final project of the 2020 Biophysics Computation module. The challenge was to use 
UCSF's own database of mmCIF files of the updated PDB and then produce a bar graph that plots the following 
information by date:
  1) Average molecular weight of structures deposited that day
  2) Number of structures deposited that day
As written, the code prompts the user for the number of files they wish to access in the database. To iterate through the 
whole database, the source code would need to be edit to delete the "test_num" variable and fix the nesting appropriately.
